# Styles Directory

This directory contains global stylesheets and design token definitions for the application.

## Purpose

- **`tokens.css`**: Defines all design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing, radii, elevation, motion parameters) as CSS custom properties. This is the single source of truth for the visual design language.
- **`global.css`**: Imports `tokens.css` and applies base Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`). It also includes global element defaults (e.g., for `body`), custom component layers, utility overrides (like scrollbar styling), and responsive/motion preferences.
- **`timeline.css`**: Contains specific styles for the Timeline component. (Note: As per recommendations, these styles should ideally be refactored to use Tailwind utilities or integrated into `tailwind.config.js` if they are dynamic or complex beyond utility classes).
- **`css-variables.test.ts`**: Contains tests to verify the CSS custom properties, ensuring design tokens are correctly defined and applied.

## Usage

- `tokens.css` is imported by `global.css`.
- `global.css` is imported once at the root of the application (e.g., in `src/index.tsx`) to apply global styles and make Tailwind utilities available.
- CSS custom properties defined in `tokens.css` are consumed by Tailwind CSS via `tailwind.config.js`.

## Organization

- Keep token definitions in `tokens.css`.
- Global styles and Tailwind setup in `global.css`.
- Component-specific CSS that cannot be achieved with Tailwind utilities should be carefully considered and ideally refactored (like `timeline.css`).
