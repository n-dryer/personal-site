# Security Action Plan

## ✅ **COMPLETED ACTIONS**

### Branch Cleanup

- ✅ Deleted irrelevant remote branches:
  - `origin/codex/create-codex-instructions-for-agent` (contained backend Python code)
  - `origin/codex/find-and-fix-bug-in-important-code-part` (contained MongoDB/backend changes)
  - Note: `origin/dependabot/npm_and_yarn/npm_and_yarn-e40b04d72c` was corrupted and contained changes from different project

### Security Hardening

- ✅ Enhanced `.gitignore` with comprehensive security patterns
- ✅ Created `SECURITY.md` with best practices and incident response procedures
- ✅ Committed and pushed security improvements to main branch

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### 1. Dependency Vulnerabilities (HIGH PRIORITY)

Current Status: **6 vulnerabilities detected by GitHub** (1 high, 3 moderate, 2 low)

**Action Plan:**

```bash
# Manual security updates needed since dependabot branch was corrupted
yarn audit --json > security-audit.json
yarn upgrade --latest --scope @types  # Safe type updates
yarn upgrade --latest react-scripts   # Update build tools
yarn test                             # Verify functionality
yarn test:e2e                         # Run end-to-end tests
```

### 2. Specific Packages to Update

- **nth-check**: Known regex complexity vulnerability
- **minimatch**: Brace expansion vulnerability  
- **@typescript-eslint packages**: Type checking vulnerabilities

### 3. Testing Strategy

Before merging any dependency updates:

- ✅ Run unit tests: `yarn test`
- ✅ Run end-to-end tests: `yarn test:e2e`
- ✅ Check linting: `yarn lint`
- ✅ Verify build: `yarn build`

## 📋 **MEDIUM PRIORITY ACTIONS**

### 1. Enable GitHub Security Features

- [ ] Enable Dependabot alerts (if not already enabled)
- [ ] Enable Secret scanning
- [ ] Enable Code scanning with CodeQL
- [ ] Review Security advisories

### 2. Install Security Tools

```bash
npm install -g gitleaks          # Scan for secrets
npm install -g git-secrets       # Prevent secret commits
npm install -g audit-ci          # CI security scanning
```

### 3. Regular Maintenance Schedule

- [ ] Weekly: `yarn audit` checks
- [ ] Monthly: Dependency updates
- [ ] Quarterly: Full security review

## 🔍 **MONITORING & PREVENTION**

### 1. Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit security scanning
npm install -D @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
npm install -D husky lint-staged
```

### 2. CI/CD Security Integration

```yaml
# Add to GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Security Audit
  run: yarn audit --level moderate
  
- name: Scan for secrets
  uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
```

### 3. Environment Security

- [ ] Ensure no credentials in environment variables
- [ ] Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- [ ] Regular rotation of any API keys

## 🎯 **SUCCESS METRICS**

- [ ] Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] All dependencies up to date
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security scanning tools installed
- [ ] Regular maintenance schedule established

## 📞 **INCIDENT RESPONSE**

If credentials are accidentally committed:

1. **Immediately** revoke/rotate the compromised credentials
2. Remove from git history: `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
3. Force push: `git push --force-with-lease`
4. Check access logs for unauthorized usage
5. Update security documentation
