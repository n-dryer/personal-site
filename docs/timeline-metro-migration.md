‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ kpiExtractor.ts              # Extracts KPIs from achievements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/Timeline/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TimelineCard.tsx             # Individual timeline card component
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TimelineMetro.tsx            # Metro map timeline implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ useTimelineObserver.ts       # IntersectionObserver for active detection
```

2. Verify CSS custom property updates in media queries
3. Check for JavaScript errors on mobile browsers

#### KPIs not extracting properly

1. Check achievement text format in experience data
2. Verify regex patterns in `kpiExtractor.ts`
3. Test with different achievement phrasings
